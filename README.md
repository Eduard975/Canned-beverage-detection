# Pi-P (Image processing project)
A project we made for the PI-P course in which we had to realize our own dataset and train an AI model to detect objects based on it.

For this project we used [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) to train the model and [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) to manage the dataset.

  During the project we created 2 datasets, one for a [demo](https://universe.roboflow.com/pi-ulvcg/crazy-wolf) which only had images of Crazy Wolf and one for the [final model](https://universe.roboflow.com/pi-ulvcg/canned-beverages) which contains a larger gamma of canned beverages.
